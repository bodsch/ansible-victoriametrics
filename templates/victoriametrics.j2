  -datadog.maxInsertRequestSize size
        The maximum size in bytes of a single DataDog POST request to /api/v1/series
        Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 67108864)
  -dedup.minScrapeInterval duration
        Leave only the first sample in every time series per each discrete interval equal to -dedup.minScrapeInterval > 0. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#deduplication and https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#downsampling
  -deleteAuthKey string
        authKey for metrics' deletion via /api/v1/admin/tsdb/delete_series and /tags/delSeries
  -denyQueriesOutsideRetention
        Whether to deny queries outside of the configured -retentionPeriod. When set, then /api/v1/query_range would return '503 Service Unavailable' error for queries with 'from' value outside -retentionPeriod. This may be useful when multiple data sources with distinct retentions are hidden behind query-tee
  -dryRun
        Whether to check only -promscrape.config and then exit. Unknown config entries aren't allowed in -promscrape.config by default. This can be changed with -promscrape.config.strictParse=false command-line flag
  -enableTCP6
        Whether to enable IPv6 for listening and dialing. By default only IPv4 TCP and UDP is used
  -envflag.enable
        Whether to enable reading flags from environment variables additionally to command line. Command line flag values have priority over values from environment vars.

  -memory.allowedBytes size
        Allowed size of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. This option overrides -memory.allowedPercent if set to a non-zero value. Too low a value may increase the cache miss rate usually resulting in higher CPU and disk IO usage. Too high a value may evict too much data from OS page cache resulting in higher disk IO usage
        Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 0)
  -memory.allowedPercent float
        Allowed percent of system memory VictoriaMetrics caches may occupy. See also -memory.allowedBytes.

  -search.maxLookback duration
        Synonym to -search.lookback-delta from Prometheus. The value is dynamically detected from interval between time series datapoints if not set. It can be overridden on per-query basis via max_lookback arg. See also '-search.maxStalenessInterval' flag, which has the same meaining due to historical reasons
  -search.maxPointsPerTimeseries int
        The maximum points per a single timeseries returned from /api/v1/query_range. This option doesn't limit the number of scanned raw samples in the database. The main purpose of this option is to limit the number of per-series points returned to graphing UI such as Grafana.

  -search.maxStalenessInterval duration
        The maximum interval for staleness calculations. By default it is automatically calculated from the median interval between samples. This flag could be useful for tuning Prometheus data model closer to Influx-style data model. See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#staleness for details. See also '-search.maxLookback' flag, which has the same meaning due to historical reasons
  -search.maxStatusRequestDuration duration
        The maximum duration for /api/v1/status/* requests (default 5m0s)
  -search.maxStepForPointsAdjustment duration
        The maximum step when /api/v1/query_range handler adjusts points with timestamps closer than -search.latencyOffset to the current time. The adjustment is needed because such points may contain incomplete data (default 1m0s)
  -search.maxTSDBStatusSeries int
        The maximum number of time series, which can be processed during the call to /api/v1/status/tsdb. This option allows limiting memory usage (default 1000000)
  -search.maxTagKeys int
        The maximum number of tag keys returned from /api/v1/labels (default 100000)
  -search.maxTagValueSuffixesPerSearch int
        The maximum number of tag value suffixes returned from /metrics/find (default 100000)
  -search.maxTagValues int
        The maximum number of tag values returned from /api/v1/label/<label_name>/values (default 100000)
  -search.maxUniqueTimeseries int
        The maximum number of unique time series, which can be selected during /api/v1/query and /api/v1/query_range queries. This option allows limiting memory usage (default 300000)
  -search.minStalenessInterval duration
        The minimum interval for staleness calculations. This flag could be useful for removing gaps on graphs generated from time series with irregular intervals between samples. See also '-search.maxStalenessInterval'
  -search.noStaleMarkers
        Set this flag to true if the database doesn't contain Prometheus stale markers, so there is no need in spending additional CPU time on its handling. Staleness markers may exist only in data obtained from Prometheus scrape targets
  -search.queryStats.lastQueriesCount int
        Query stats for /api/v1/status/top_queries is tracked on this number of last queries. Zero value disables query stats tracking (default 20000)
  -search.queryStats.minQueryDuration duration
        The minimum duration for queries to track in query stats at /api/v1/status/top_queries. Queries with lower duration are ignored in query stats (default 1ms)
  -search.resetCacheAuthKey string
        Optional authKey for resetting rollup cache via /internal/resetRollupResultCache call
  -search.treatDotsAsIsInRegexps
        Whether to treat dots as is in regexp label filters used in queries. For example, foo{bar=~"a.b.c"} will be automatically converted to foo{bar=~"a\\.b\\.c"}, i.e. all the dots in regexp filters will be automatically escaped in order to match only dot char instead of matching any char. Dots in ".+", ".*" and ".{n}" regexps aren't escaped. This option is DEPRECATED in favor of {__graphite__="a.*.c"} syntax for selecting metrics matching the given Graphite metrics filter
  -selfScrapeInstance string
        Value for 'instance' label, which is added to self-scraped metrics (default "self")
  -selfScrapeInterval duration
        Interval for self-scraping own metrics at /metrics page
  -selfScrapeJob string
        Value for 'job' label, which is added to self-scraped metrics (default "victoria-metrics")
  -smallMergeConcurrency int
        The maximum number of CPU cores to use for small merges. Default value is used if set to 0
  -snapshotAuthKey string
        authKey, which must be passed in query string to /snapshot* pages
  -sortLabels
        Whether to sort labels for incoming samples before writing them to storage. This may be needed for reducing memory usage at storage when the order of labels in incoming samples is random. For example, if m{k1="v1",k2="v2"} may be sent as m{k2="v2",k1="v1"}. Enabled sorting for labels can slow down ingestion performance a bit
  -storage.cacheSizeIndexDBDataBlocks size
        Overrides max size for indexdb/dataBlocks cache. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#cache-tuning
        Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 0)
  -storage.cacheSizeIndexDBIndexBlocks size
        Overrides max size for indexdb/indexBlocks cache. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#cache-tuning
        Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 0)
  -storage.cacheSizeStorageTSID size
        Overrides max size for storage/tsid cache. See https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#cache-tuning
        Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 0)
  -storage.maxDailySeries int
        The maximum number of unique series can be added to the storage during the last 24 hours. Excess series are logged and dropped. This can be useful for limiting series churn rate. See also -storage.maxHourlySeries
  -storage.maxHourlySeries int
        The maximum number of unique series can be added to the storage during the last hour. Excess series are logged and dropped. This can be useful for limiting series cardinality. See also -storage.maxDailySeries
  -storage.minFreeDiskSpaceBytes size
        The minimum free disk space at -storageDataPath after which the storage stops accepting new data
        Supports the following optional suffixes for size values: KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB (default 10000000)
  -storageDataPath string
        Path to storage data (default "victoria-metrics-data")
  -tls
        Whether to enable TLS (aka HTTPS) for incoming requests. -tlsCertFile and -tlsKeyFile must be set if -tls is set
  -tlsCertFile string
        Path to file with TLS certificate. Used only if -tls is set. Prefer ECDSA certs instead of RSA certs as RSA certs are slower. The provided certificate file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  -tlsKeyFile string
        Path to file with TLS key. Used only if -tls is set. The provided key file is automatically re-read every second, so it can be dynamically updated
  -version
        Show VictoriaMetrics version
